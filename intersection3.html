      <h1>THE BOY WHO LIVED TO ARRIVE AT HOGWARTS</h1>
      <p>The Daily Prophet can exclusively confirm that Harry Potter, the boy who so famously avoided a Killing Curse
        issued by You-Know-Who at the mere age of 1, has finally been enrolled at Hogwarts school. 'I went an' got 'im!
        Special job off Dumbledore!' Hogwarts gamekeeper, Rubeus Hagrid, says proudly. Hagrid is humongously large and
        alarming in sight, and perhaps it should be investigated as to why Dumbledore would entrust this man with the
        care of such a valuable boy. Hagrid seems excited for Harry's arrival, as he wipes his eyes on a large tissue
        and says, 'I know 'e's gonna be a great wizard. Look at 'is parents!'</p>
      <p>However, a clever young boy Harry's age, Draco Malfoy, says otherwise. 'I met Potter in Madam Malkins' robe
        shop in Diagon Alley when both of us were buying our schoolthings,' Draco told reporters, 'and he was thick as
        they come. Barely said a word. He'd never even heard of Quidditch! The way he acted was a disgrace to wizards,
        if you ask me.'</p>
      <p>We are all looking forward to seeing Harry at Hogwarts, and The Daily Prophet will keep you up-to-date with
        his time there.</p>

      <h1>MASS BREAKOUT FROM AZKABAN</h1>
      <p>We have confirmed that ten high-security prisoners, in the early hours of yesterday evening, did escape. And of course, the Muggle Prime Minister has been alerted to the danger. We strongly suspect that the breakout was engineered by a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban; notorious mass murderer Sirius Black, cousin of the escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Magic announced late last night that there has been a mass breakout from Azkaban. Speaking to reporters in his private office, Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic, confirmed that ten high-security prisoners escaped in the early hours of yesterday evening, and that he has already informed the Muggle Prime Minister of the dangerous nature of these individuals. "We find ourselves, most unfortunately, in the same position we were two and a half years ago when the murderer Sirius Black escaped," said Fudge last night. "Nor do we think the two breakouts are unrelated. An escape of this magnitude suggests outside help, and we must remember that Black, as the first person ever to break out of Azkaban, would be ideally placed to help others follow in his footsteps. We think it likely that these individuals, who include Black's cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, have rallied around Black as their leader. We are, however, doing all we can to round up the criminals and beg the magical community to remain alert and cautious. On no account should any of these individuals be approached.</p>
